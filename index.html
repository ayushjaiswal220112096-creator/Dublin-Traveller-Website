            <h2>What to expect in Dublin?</h2>
            <p><b>Language:</b> English is the main language spoken in Dublin, and most people that you meet will speak it. Although you probably won’t encounter someone who only speaks Irish Gaelic and can’t communicate at least a little bit in English, it’s important to know that Irish Gaelic is the other official language of the country.</p>
            <p><b>Currency:</b> The Euro (€)</p>
            <p><b>Credit Cards and Banks:</b> You’ll have access to ATMs while you’re traveling through Dublin if you would like to withdraw cash, although these will likely come with some fees for using an ATM not run by your bank. You’ll also be able to use your credit card at most places within the city so even if you don’t have too much cash on hand, you’ll be fine.</p>
            <p><b>Climate:</b> Summers in Dublin are pleasant; winters are long, cold, and wet; and it is windy and partly cloudy all year. Be sure to bring at least one pair of shoes that’s suitable for rainy weather and you can’t go wrong with a rain jacket.</p>
